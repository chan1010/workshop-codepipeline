### Introduction
The topic "Automating Application Development with CodePipeline on AWS" aims to provide an understanding of the process of automating application development with AWS services. Specifically, it will guide you through setting up and using CodePipeline to automate the application development process.

Through this, you will understand how to use CodePipeline to build a complete development workflow on AWS, including source code management, code testing, packaging, deployment, and testing. Additionally, participants will be introduced to the tools and resources that support the automated development process on AWS.

### CodePipeline
CodePipeline is an AWS service that provides a solution for automating the software development process (CI/CD) from building, testing, approval, to deployment and release of the application. CodePipeline allows you to create and manage software development workflows (pipelines) by linking different tools such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, ECS, EKS, and various CI/CD tools. CodePipeline provides a visual and easy-to-use pipeline manager that allows users to quickly and easily create, modify, add, delete stages or actions in the pipeline.
